# MF-PAM_pytorch
This repo is the official Pytorch implementation of ["MF-PAM: Accurate Pitch Estimation through Periodicity Analysis and Multi-level Feature Fusion"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09640) accepted in INTERSPEECH 2023.


In the paper we predicted the quantized f0 with BCELoss.

However, you can also directly estimate the f0 value with L1 loss, which gives a more accurate VAD performance. (To Do)
